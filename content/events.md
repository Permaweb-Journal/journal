The permaweb is more than software, it is a global community.

This page curates key gatherings across the Arweave and AO ecosystem: from hackathons and summits to community meetups.

Whether you're a builder, creator, founder, or curious observer, these recaps aim to capture the energy, insights, and breakthroughs shaping the future of the permaweb.

## AO Permabites

[Permabites](https://x.com/aoTheComputer/status/1916849808154800460) is a grassroots IRL growth project designed to support in-person gatherings for the permaweb community. Working in crypto and remote-first environments can make it hard to meet collaborators or even see familiar faces offline. Permabites helps fix that.

Approved events receive **$100 in AR tokens** to help cover food, space, or other simple expenses.
