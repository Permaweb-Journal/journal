## I. Introduction

AO offers technical infrastructure that other blockchains simply can’t. The ability to run unlimited processes in parallel, without waiting for a global queue to execute, unlocks new opportunities for builders. Gaming on AO is one of the most exciting areas to watch. This post explores why AO is positioned to become a leading gaming chain.

## II. Fully onchain games

StarGrid Battle Tactics just launched the private beta for its new 1v1 strategy game. Their motto? _Making a crypto game that doesn’t suck._

A core belief of the team is that most crypto games fail because they aren’t truly onchain, defeating the purpose of building in crypto in the first place. On top of that, many rely on unsustainable incentives, depending on the memability of in-game NFTs and token drops rather than solid game mechanics.

StarGrid is taking a different approach by building its game **fully onchain**, every single interaction is a transaction on AO, permanently stored on [Arweave](reference/arweave.md). This is possible because each game instance spawns AO processes that run in parallel, never competing for execution.

The [StarGrid private beta just went live on March 25, 2025](https://x.com/StarGridBattle/status/1904586205108572527). If all goes well, StarGrid could set the bar for truly onchain gaming.

Another game currently in beta testing is [Dumverse](https://x.com/dumdumznfts), an adventure game featuring the beloved Dumdumz elephant NFTs in a beautifully animated world. All game data is stored on Arweave and runs on AO. Test out the beta here.

Fully onchain games, and fully onchain applications in general, ensure that games remain permanently accessible and censorship-resistant. If a game isn’t truly onchain, what’s the point of building it in Web3 at all? Without decentralization as a priority, it would be far easier to take the Web2 route.

## III. Composable protocols

The permaweb prioritizes **protocols over products**. Instead of siloed applications, developers build interoperable protocols that anyone can integrate. Some key examples:

- [Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)](reference/ucm.md) – A trustless, onchain order book protocol for exchanging digital content
- [Reality Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SxIlsM2aIQ) – A framework for building 2D worlds powered by AO and Arweave
- [Stamps Protocol](https://stamps.arweave.net/#/en/main)– A universal “like” button for the permaweb
- [Vouch Protocol](reference/vouch.md) – A proof-of-humanity verification system

These composable protocols solve the cold start problem for consumer web applications. Developers can leverage existing data pools, while users enjoy a seamless, interconnected experience.

Another project to watch is Basejump, which is developing a gaming substrate called $ACTION. It aims to enable the creation and interoperability of digital worlds, games, assets, and communities. See their [whitepaper here](https://github.com/basejump-xyz/action-whitepaper/blob/main/action-whitepaper.pdf).

## IV. LLMs in a single process

[Llamaland](https://x.com/LlamaLandAO), built on Reality Protocol, showcases how AI can run in a single AO process.

In this MMO game, players must petition the Llama King to receive $LLAMA tokens. The twist? The Llama King is actually an AI agent that evaluates petitions and only rewards worthy players. This AI banker is an instance of LLAMA-3, running entirely within a single AO process.

This experiment demonstrates how AO supports onchain AI, rather than just storing AI-related data while relying on offchain resources. While most blockchains integrate AI as a buzzword, AO actually makes it possible.

Beyond gaming, AI-driven finance (AgentFi) is emerging, with DeFi platforms integrating onchain AI bots that make automated, verifiable decisions. The same concept could extend to AO-based games, introducing a new dynamic to crypto gaming.

## V. Games to watch

A few games to watch out for in 2025:

- [StarGrid Battle Tactics](https://x.com/StarGridBattle) - 1v1 strategy game
- [Dumverse](https://x.com/dumdumznfts) - Adventure game based on the popular DumDumz NFT collection
- [Basejump](https://x.com/basejumpxyz) - Developing the $ACTION gaming substrate for interoperable digital worlds
- [RuneRealm](https://x.com/runerealm_ao) - MMORPG built on Reality Protocol

## VI. Challenges and how AO compares to other gaming chains

Most crypto gaming chains focus on scalability and asset ownership, but AO goes a step further by enabling fully onchain games where every action is recorded as an immutable transaction stored on Arweave. Platforms like Ronin and Immutable are optimized for low-cost NFT transactions with little to no gas fees, but they rely heavily on offchain game logic to maintain performance. Because most chains depend on a global shared state, scaling fully onchain applications, especially games, remains a significant challenge.

AO’s approach avoids this bottleneck by allowing unlimited parallel processes without global state contention. However, the AO ecosystem faces its own challenges, particularly around infrastructure stability. With AO currently transitioning from [legacynet to mainnet](legacynet-mainnet-transition.md), much of the stack is still evolving.

The upside is that game developers on AO can own their entire stack, from [gateways](reference/gateways.md) and compute nodes to [AR-based domain names](https://arns.app/), giving them unmatched control and flexibility.

Another hurdle is timing. AO is still early, and consumer-facing applications haven’t yet achieved mainstream recognition. For games to succeed, they’ll need more than strong tech. They need strong IP and compelling experiences. Projects like Basejump and Dumdumz, which build on existing NFT communities, have a start with core supporters. But in the end, success will come down to making fun, replayable games, not just offering the potential to earn.

## VII. Conclusion

AO’s ability to run parallel processes, its emphasis on composable protocols, and its support for fully onchain AI make it an ideal environment for crypto gaming. As more projects integrate AO’s tech stack, we’re witnessing the rise of **the first true gaming chain**, one that doesn’t just tokenize assets but **puts the entire game onchain**.

If games can be built on AO, anything can be built on AO. Watch out for permaweb gaming.
