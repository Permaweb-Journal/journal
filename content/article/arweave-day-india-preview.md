## What Is Arweave Day India?

[Arweave Day India](https://www.arweaveindia.com/adi) is a community event for developers, founders, and explorers building the future of permanent applications.

Hosted in Bengaluru on April 26, the event brings together the minds behind Arweave, AO, and the broader permaweb stack. It’s more than a tech conference. This is a space to connect with the community, share ideas, and shape what’s next for the ecosystem.

## Why It Matters

- **[First Arweave Day India.](https://x.com/arweaveindia/status/1912415152525181001)** The permaweb is going global, landing in the tech hub of India, Bengaluru.
- **[AO mainnet is live.](https://permaweb-journal.arweave.net/article/ao-mainnet-live.html)** The hyper-parallel computer is up and running, and the Arweave India community is ready to build on it.
- **Builders are shipping.** Expect creative ideas, new projects, and a week of collaborative building.

## What to Watch

- **Talks.** Core contributors and early adopters will share insights into what they’re building and where the permaweb is heading.
- **Culture.** Permaweb Journal will be on the ground capturing the energy, the ideas, and the real-world pulse of the ecosystem.
