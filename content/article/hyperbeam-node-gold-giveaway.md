The AO team is giving away a **PURE GOLD floppy disk** (valued at over $10,000) as part of a campaign to onboard new node operators and decentralize the AO network.

This is a rare opportunity to help expand the network and win a one-of-a-kind collector’s prize.

**How to Enter**

- Spin up a HyperBEAM node on AO (existing nodes qualify)
- Submit your node’s public IP in the **gold-standard-nodes** channel on the [HyperBEAM Discord](https://discord.gg/nYbkajGd)
- Complete verification by **April 4, midnight EST**

The winner will be selected **randomly**, with publicly posted proof.

**Deadline:** April 4 at midnight EST

## What is HyperBEAM?

HyperBeam is a client implementation of the AO-Core protocol, functioning as the node software for AO’s decentralized operating system. It abstracts hardware details, allowing programs to run seamlessly across the network.

At its core, HyperBEAM includes:

- A **Compute Unit (CU)**, built in NodeJS, responsible for WASM execution and AO state management
- **TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** support for private and verifiable computation
- A plug-and-play system of AO **devices**, each representing a piece of functionality within the stack

**Device Maturity Levels:** HyperBEAM currently ships with ~25 core devices, categorized into three tiers:

- **Candidate (green):** Stable and production-ready
- **Preview (orange):** Usable, but not yet hardened for critical workloads
- **Early Access:** Experimental and subject to change

## What is AO-Core?

AO-Core is the protocol powering decentralized computation on AO. Unlike traditional blockchain VMs, it’s designed to support multiple execution models in a unified environment.

Core concepts:

- Hashpaths – Merkle-style references for verifying a program’s inputs and initial state
- Unified state representation – AO process state is stored as an HTTP-compatible document
- Attestations – Nodes can verify or challenge others’ outputs, building cryptographic and economic trust
- Meta-VM – Supports diverse computational models (WASM, AI agents, LLMs) under a single verification framework

## Why run a node?

HyperBEAM is currently in a preview phase meaning nearly feature-complete, with active development and new capabilities being added weekly.

Recent updates include:

- Legacynet SU compatibility (Milestone 3)
- TEE-based nodes acting as a unified, Sybil-resistant network
- Caching for scheduler requests, allowing apps to reuse previous results and reduce latency
- Improved error handling for web apps, making debugging easier for developers
- Enhanced HTTP signature support for more flexible and secure node-to-node communication

Because AO uses a holographic state model—where all processes live permanently on [Arweave](reference/arweave.md), there’s no hard cutoff between testnet and mainnet. The network evolves progressively.

Running a node now means early access to AO’s architecture, hands-on experience with modular compute, and a role in supporting the transition from legacynet to mainnet.
