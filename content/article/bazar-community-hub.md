## I. Introduction
The Weavers Discord is now officially part of [Bazar](bazar.md). As the creative and developer hub of the permaweb, Bazar is expanding its support for ecosystem projects by launching **Bazar Community Hub**, a system for micro-communities within the [Bazar Discord](https://discord.gg/vS2fYJNucN).

## II. What is the Bazar Community Hub?

The Community Hub gives creators, developers, and projects a dedicated space within the Bazar Discord without the overhead of spinning up their own server.

New projects often face the cold-start problem. Setting up and maintaining a standalone Discord is time-consuming and difficult without an existing community. Bazar solves this by offering shared infrastructure and visibility through its Community Hub.

If youâ€™re building something on the permaweb, you can [apply for a micro-community here](https://form.typeform.com/to/OkuA1uLK). Each space can include:

- General chat channels
- Announcements
- Resource forums
- Ticketing systems
    

  

The Bazar team will review each application and follow up with next steps.

## III. Before you apply

- Bazar reserves the right to remove any micro-community that violates our guidelines, engages in scams, or exhibits harmful behavior.
- Participation does **not** imply endorsement by Bazar.
- Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research) before engaging with any group or project.
    
## IV. Why micro-communities matter

The permaweb ecosystem is largely developer-driven. Much of the energy is focused on infrastructure like [AO](ao.md), [HyperBEAM](hyperbeam-overview.md), and protocol-level tools. While necessary, this emphasis can leave creative projects under-supported.

Bazar is addressing this. As a platform for publishing, collecting, and trading atomic assets, it gives creators a way to share their work and build community without needing separate tooling or platforms.

Not every project needs its own Discord. Fragmentation leads to siloed groups and lower engagement. The Bazar Community Hub consolidates the creative and application-layer ecosystem into one accessible space.

## Next steps

- **Join the Bazar Discord** to connect with other builders and creatives.
- Navigate to the **# opt-in** channel to browse active micro-communities.
- [Apply for your own micro-community here](https://form.typeform.com/to/OkuA1uLK).

## V. Conclusion 

Bazar is undergoing a backend upgrade. The team is migrating to HyperBEAM and AO, bringing improved performance and a streamlined user experience. As the platform evolves, so will the Community Hub, offering creators better tools to grow and collaborate in the permaweb.

Permaweb Journal now has its own micro-community in the Bazar Discord. Opt in to follow updates, request features, and connect directly with the team.
