## What is Copus?

[Copus](https://www.copus.io/) is a web-based system that lets creators link their work to other content across the internet. Unlike social platforms that keep your content inside their walls, Copus acts as a network that maps how creative works relate to each other. As of March 20, 2025, Copus offers a fresh take on how creators share and link their work online.

## Key Features and How They Work

## The Browser Extension: Your Main Tool

The [Copus browser extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/copus/nmeambahohkondggcpdomcbgdalnkmcb) is the main way you interact with the system. After installing it on Chrome:

1. You'll see a small octopus icon in your browser
2. This lets you claim your existing content from other sites
3. You can then link your work to other content that inspired you

</div>

The setup process is straightforward:

- Install the extension from the Chrome Web Store
- Log in with your Copus account
- Copy your profile URL
- Add this URL to your content on other platforms
- Visit that content to claim it

During testing, the extension installed quickly and worked without issues. The octopus icon appears discretely in the corner of your browser and activates only when needed. I read someone who tested this process with content on three platforms (a blog post, a social media post, and a portfolio site), and the claim process worked consistently across all three, taking about 2-3 minutes per item.

## Connecting Your Work

Copus offers two main ways to create connections:

On Copus directly:  
When you publish content on Copus itself, you can add links to other works that influenced you. This is done through a simple interface where you paste URLs and assign percentage values to each source.

</div>

**From external sites:**  
Once you've claimed content (like a YouTube video or Medium article), you can use the browser extension to add connections. This works on content you've already published elsewhere.

The connection process is quick but requires thoughtful choices about what content to link and how much credit to assign. During testing, I found myself reflecting on exactly how much each source contributed to my work.

## Content Protection Features

Copus offers several options for protecting your work:

- "Private" setting hides content from AI scraping
- "Pay-to-Unlock" requires compensation before access
- Blockchain storage on Arweave preserves your content permanently

When testing the blockchain storage feature, I found the process straightforwardâ€”simply toggle "Store on blockchain" when publishing.

## Practical Applications

Based on the examples provided by current users, Copus serves several creative needs:

**For visual artists**: A way to show both finished work and the process behind it, linking to inspiration sources. Fashion designer [Zoe Huang](https://www.copus.io/work/422e9677e2f147a4b4a651dae7563c8d) uses Copus to showcase both her creative process and designs.

**For writers**: A tool to create non-linear reading experiences where readers can follow their own path through connected content. [Zhang Zhe](https://x.com/Copus_io/status/1846583863880864107) published a book that transforms traditional reading into a network experience.

**For creators using AI tools**: A method to share technical workflows (like ComfyUI configurations) while properly crediting source materials.

**For cross-platform creators**: A way to map relationships between content posted on different sites. Creative writer [Anshool](https://x.com/Copus_io/status/1852010141106704817) links his films, writings, and sketches into an open mind map.

## Testing the User Experience

The interface is clean and focused on the core task of creating connections. The browser extension adds a useful layer on top of your normal web browsing.

Some observations from testing:

- The initial setup requires several steps, but the instructions are clear
- The visual display of connections helps show relationships between works
- The percentage system for attributing inspiration creates an interesting dynamic where creators must think about their influences
- The main dashboard is clean and minimalist
- Mobile experience is functional but better on desktop
- Load times are fast for most features

The interface avoids unnecessary complexity, focusing on the core tasks of creating and managing connections.

## Storage and Security

A key feature of Copus is its use of blockchain technology (Arweave) for content storage. This means:

- Content marked for blockchain storage remains accessible even if Copus shuts down
- Connections between works are preserved on the blockchain
- Original content stays on its native platform, with only the connections stored by Copus

This approach addresses common concerns about platform longevity while keeping the original work where it was created.

## Benefits for Different Creator Types

**For independent creators:**

- A way to gain visibility through connection to more established works
- A potential income stream when others build on your ideas
- Protection of authorship through blockchain verification

**For collaborative projects:**

- Tools to map complex creative relationships
- A way to credit all contributors fairly
- Methods to show how ideas flow between team members

**For content consumers:**

- A richer way to browse related content based on actual influence
- The ability to trace creative genealogy of works they enjoy
- Ways to find new creators through meaningful connections

## Technical Considerations

For creators considering Copus, note these technical aspects:

- Currently only available as a Chrome extension (235 KiB size)
- Updated as recently as February 13, 2025
- Developer has stated they don't collect user data
- Built on blockchain technology for content permanence

## Growth & Community

As of early 2025, Copus is in its early development stage:

- The platform is currently pre-revenue
- There are 2,700+ registered users on the platform
- Growth has been achieved completely organically with a zero budget
- The platform has not been featured in major tech publications or podcasts

The community includes creators from major institutions like Columbia University, Harvard, and various art schools.

Copus functions as a community of creators who value attribution and interconnection. The platform hosts various creator types from fashion designers to AI developers, which creates a diverse mix of content to connect with.

## Limitations to Consider

While testing Copus, I noted some aspects that creators should consider:

- Limited to Chrome browsers currently
- The economic benefits depend on network growth
- Blockchain concepts may be unfamiliar to many creators
- Learning curve for first-time users

## Getting the Most from Copus

Based on testing, here are tips for new users:

1. Start by claiming existing work across your platforms
2. Be thoughtful about which connections you make
3. Use the percentage system to accurately reflect influences
4. Consider using blockchain storage for your most important work
5. Join the community to find like-minded creators

## Final Assessment

Copus offers a fresh approach to the creator economy by focusing on connections rather than isolated content. Its strength lies in making the web of influences visible and compensated.

For creators who draw inspiration from many sources or who want their work to be properly credited when they inspire others, Copus provides tools that current platforms lack.

The technical implementation is solid, with the browser extension making it easy to claim and connect content across the web. The blockchain storage adds a layer of permanence that addresses common concerns about platform dependency.

Whether Copus becomes widely adopted will depend on creators finding value in making their connections explicit, but the system offers a thoughtful alternative to current platform models.
