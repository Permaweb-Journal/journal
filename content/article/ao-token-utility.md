Unlike many conventional tokens with narrow purposes, the AO token is designed to serve as the economic backbone of a decentralized supercomputing network. It powers everything from security and computation to ecosystem development and self-sustaining funding. This article outlines the AO token’s distinct roles within the protocol and how each function contributes to a robust, future-ready infrastructure.

## Network Security

The AO token is fundamental to securing the network and ensuring honest participation:

- **Validator staking**: Nodes must stake AO tokens as collateral to participate in computation. This staking model discourages malicious behavior through public slashing mechanisms that penalize dishonesty.
- **Sybil and message integrity**: AO supports security through the _AO-Sec Origin_ (for collateralized message passing) and the _SIV_ mechanism (for Sybil-resistant attestations). These tools can be used independently or together to strengthen network integrity.

## Computation Payments

AO serves as the native currency for accessing computational resources across the decentralized network:

- **Efficient resource use**: AO tokens are used to pay for computational messages, which are the core support for processes. Users pay AO to interact with processes, while node operators are rewarded in AO for executing those tasks—functioning similarly to gas in other blockchain environments.

## Ecosystem Growth and Sustainable Funding

Beyond its technical role, AO supports decentralized funding for developers and projects:

- **[Permaweb Index (PI) mechanism](permaweb-index.md)**: Token holders can delegate their yield to ecosystem projects. For example, users staking assets like stETH can redirect AO rewards to specific initiatives and receive project tokens in return, creating a decentralized alternative to VC funding.
- **[Fair launch model](ao-yield.md)**: The PI token distributes rewards evenly—33.3% to AO, 33.3% to AR, and 33.3% to new projects—creating a balanced, systematic way to bootstrap ecosystem innovation.

## Economic Design That Supports Utility

The [AO token’s economic model](https://mirror.xyz/0x1EE4bE8670E8Bd7E9E2E366F530467030BE4C840/-UWra0q0KWecSpgg2-c37dbZ0lnOMEScEEkabVm9qaQ) is intentionally structured to reinforce its long-term utility, security, and sustainability:

- **Scarcity with purpose**: With a capped supply of 21 million tokens and a 4-year halving cycle, AO adopts a Bitcoin-inspired issuance model. This scarcity supports long-term value and predictable supply, which benefits builders, validators, and users.
- **Fair distribution = healthy ecosystem**: AO avoids presales and insider allocations, ensuring a wide, decentralized holder base. Approximately 36% of the supply goes to AR token holders, while 64% is minted through yield and asset-bridging, aligning incentives across stakeholders.
- **Built-in self-funding**: Instead of relying on token sales, the AO network finances its development through the native yield generated by bridged, non-native assets. This model enables ongoing protocol growth and ecosystem support—without ever needing to sell the core AO token. Because funding is decoupled from the token’s market activity, it eliminates risks like insider selling and ensures that AO’s utility remains aligned with long-term ecosystem health.

The AO token isn’t just a utility token—it’s the lifeblood of a real decentralized supercomputer. By anchoring core operations like computation, enabling decentralized funding, and maintaining a sound economic model, AO empowers a scalable, sustainable future. Its design reflects a commitment to long-term value creation and technological resilience, leaning into the permanence of its forever foundation: Arweave.
